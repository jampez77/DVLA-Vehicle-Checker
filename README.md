## Installation through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)
You can install the **DVLA Vehicle Enquiry Service** integration by searching for it there in HA instance.

## Manual Installation
Use this route only if you do not want to use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) and love the pain of manually installing regular updates.
* Add the `dvla` folder in your `custom_components` folder

## Usage

Before you can configure this sensor, you must register and obtain and API key at [VES API Registration](https://register-for-ves.driver-vehicle-licensing.api.gov.uk/).

The API is ratelimited, this is predefined when filling in the registration form under `Estimated monthly enquiry volumes` input. The default `scan interval` is every 6 hours (21600 seconds), this translates to about `62` for `Estimated monthly enquiry volumes`. 

You can change this value at any time by configuring the `scan interval` for an instance. You should take the rate limiting into account when setting the `scan interval` and vice versa.

Also make sure to select `no` for Testing otherwise you won't have access to any live data.
